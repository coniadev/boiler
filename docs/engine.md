Engine
======

The `Engine` is the Boiler's central object and usually the only one you have to 
manually instatiate. 

Throughout the doucmentation we assume the following directory structure:

```text
path
`-- to
    |-- templates
    |   |-- layout.php
    |   |-- more.php
    |   `-- page.php
    `-- additional
        |-- subdir
        |   `-- subtemplate.php
        `-- template.php
```
